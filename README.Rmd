The goal of the `QComics` package is to have a quick overview of the quality of a metabolomics or lipidomics study. For this, a pooled sample (QCpool) needs to measured 
in regular intervals during one or more sequences. These QCpool samples need to be analysed with Sciex Multiquant (> v3.0.3) software and exported to `txt` format.

## Installation

You can install the development version of QComics like so:

``` r
remotes::install_github("ricoderks/QComics")
```

## Usage

### Locally

From Rstudio run the app as:

``` r
QComics::run_app()
```

or if you want the app to run in the browser use:

``` r
QComics::run_in_browser()
```

### Shiny server

To run it from a shiny server you have to make sure the package is installed and then you only have to create a file called `app.R` in the folder where you want to run it from. The file `app.R` should only contain:

``` r
QComics::run_app()
```
